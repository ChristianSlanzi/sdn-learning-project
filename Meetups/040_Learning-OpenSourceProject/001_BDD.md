# Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)

Behaviour Driven Development, aka BDD, is an Agile methodology that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and business participants in the software projects. 

It is a set of practices that focus on feature specification and application behavior where the goal is to have a notation (given, when, then) that is understandable by everyone.



## Given, when, then

Is the way we describe a test case using BDD where:



**Given:** Represents the context in which your behavior will be in. It is the state that your behavior will have before its start.

**When:** Is the behavior you are testing, describes what is going to happen.

**Then:** Describes the expected output based on the context(Given) and the behavior (When).



### Example:

**Feature**: Redirect user to profile screen

**Scenario**: User profile



**Given** 		The user is logged in

**When**		 The user taps the profile picture	

**Then**		  It should be redirected to the profile screen

We'll make use of Quick and Nimble frameworks to write BDD specifications in our project.
