# S.O.L.I.D. code principles



#### **S**ingle **R**esponsibility **P**rinciple

A component (module, class, function) should be responsible to only one thing.

#### **O**pen **C**losed **P**rinciple

A component (module, class, function) should be open for extensions and closed for modifications.

#### **L**iskov **S**ubstitution **P**rinciple

It states that derived subtypes must behave like their basic types, whereby subtypes may extend the functionalities of the basic types but not restrict them.

#### **I**nformation **H**iding **P**rinciple

The inner workings of components should be encapsulated or hidden by interfaces in order to avoid unnecessary dependencies and extensive adjustments.

#### **D**ependency **I**nversion **P**rinciple

Modules of higher levels do not depend on modules of lower levels, modules depend on abstractions and abstractions should not depend on details but details on abstractions.
